## 📖 Abstract

Traditional museum catalogs are static lists, flattening cultural artifacts into mere 2D images. **Latent Kiln** reimagines the archive as a dynamic, living system. 

By training four distinct neural networks to perceive **texture, silhouette, mass, and volume**, we have transformed a dataset of thousands of ceramic vases (sourced from the V&A Museum) into a navigable **"Morphological Globe."** This project bridges the gap between the static archive and generative creation, allowing users to explore history not by date, but by form.

## 🧠 The Computational Pipeline (Backend)

This project is powered by a custom multi-modal machine learning pipeline developed in **Python**.

### 1. Data Mining & Preprocessing
*   **Source:** Aggregated 4,000+ images via the **Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) API**.
*   **Cleaning:** Automated "Pseudo-labeling" using a pre-trained classifier to sort the massive unlabelled archive.
*   **Processing:** Automated background removal (`rembg`) and edge detection (`Canny`) to prepare clean datasets.

### 2. The 4 Perceptual Models
We trained four separate ResNet-18 classifiers to analyze artifacts from different aesthetic dimensions:
1.  **📸 Photo Model:** Analyzes color, texture, and surface materiality.
2.  **✏️ Edge Model:** Analyzes pure silhouette and shape (used for sketch-to-search).
3.  **🌗 Grayscale Model:** Analyzes lighting and structure, ignoring glaze colors.
4.  **🧊 Depth Model:** Analyzes 3D volumetric topology and massing.

### 3. Asset Generation
*   **Volumetric Reconstruction:** Generated high-quality grayscale Depth Maps using **ZoeDepth** for 2.5D web visualization.
*   **Morphological Segmentation:** Developed a "Human-in-the-loop" interactive slicer to deconstruct vases into **Neck, Body, and Base** for the generative parts library.

### 4. Visualization & Embedding
*   **Latent Space Mapping:** Calculated 6-axis radial coordinates for every artifact, creating a "Universe Map" where spatial proximity equals stylistic similarity.

## 💻 The Web Interface (Frontend)

The frontend is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Three.js**, offering two distinct modes of interaction:

### Mode A: Intent-Driven Creation (The Tool)
*   **Sketch-to-Search:** Users sketch a silhouette, and the system retrieves the semantically nearest artifact using the Edge Model embeddings.
*   **Generative Remix:** A collage tool allowing users to recombine artifact fragments (e.g., an Asian Neck + African Body) to curate hypothetical "Digital Hybrids."

### Mode B: Serendipitous Exploration (The Experience)
*   **Morphological Globe:** An exo-centric view of history. Users orbit a virtual sphere where vases are clustered by style.
*   **2.5D Parallax Effect:** Utilizing a custom WebGL shader and Depth Maps, artifacts react to mouse movement, revealing their volume and surface curvature.

*   **Data Processing:** OpenCV, PIL, Matplotlib, V&A API.
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js, TailwindCSS.
